This model,taken from a Google research paper uses the inception network which instead of using inter-layer filters of a particular type,rather uses all of the possible combinations of filters in the same layer by stacking them up together.To further reduce the number of
computations,a network-in-a-network concept is used.To provide efficient training triplet loss function is used.
